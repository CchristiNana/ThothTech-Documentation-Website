## Introduction

CourseFlow is a clear and easy-to-use course planning platform that helps students navigate their course requirements and graduate with confidence.

This product was initially a RapidX project founded in Trimester 1, 2023 by:
- Mel
- Kieron
- Ted

To fully realize this project into a working minimum viable product, this document will utilize previously established foundational work from diagrams, proof of concepts and prototypes to provide these key points:

- A clear outline of the problem to be solved.
- A proposed solution.
- A high level overview of requirements in relation to the problem.
- A detailed break-down of key components of the overall system.


### Problem Definition

At Deakin University, a large repertoire of courses are available for potential students to enrol in to help shape their future career goals. Each of these courses will have a set of requirements ranging from minimum credit points achieved, completion of core units and minor/major stream for set units etc. Additionally, the units themselves can also have certain requirements/restrictions such as pre-requisites, co-requisites and minimum number of units completed etc.

These course and unit requirements can prove to be a challenge to keep track off and manage for some students. As such, there is a need for a tool that can help students plan their course and help them manage their course and unit requirements. This allows them to have a seamless experience with their degree where requirements can easily be managed so that they can focus on their studies and achieve their goals.

CourseFlow aims to be that tool which will facilitate an easy-to-use interface for students to plan their degree and be capable of considering course and unit requirements to ensure students can fulfill all requirements of their course.

### Target Audience

Students who struggle to or simply desire to keep track of and manage their course and unit requirements.

### Scope

A working MVP that aims to have a functioning editable course map for each year and trimester with a saveable state and unit/course requirements handled accordingly.
