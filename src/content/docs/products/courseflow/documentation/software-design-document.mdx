## 1. Introduction

CourseFlow is a clear and easy-to-use course planning platform that helps students navigate their course requirements and graduate with confidence.

This product was initially a RapidX project founded in Trimester 1, 2023 by:
- Mel
- Kieron
- Ted

To fully realize this project into a working minimum viable product, this document will utilize previously established foundational work from diagrams, proof of concepts and prototypes to provide these key points:

- A clear outline of the problem to be solved.
- A proposed solution.
- A high level overview of requirements in relation to the problem.
- A detailed break-down of key components of the overall system.


### 1.1 Problem Definition

At Deakin University, a large repertoire of courses are available for potential students to enrol in to help shape their future career goals. Each of these courses will have a set of requirements ranging from minimum credit points achieved, completion of core units and minor/major stream for set units etc. Additionally, the units themselves can also have certain requirements/restrictions such as pre-requisites, co-requisites and minimum number of units completed etc.

These course and unit requirements can prove to be a challenge to keep track off and manage for some students. As such, there is a need for a tool that can help students plan their course and help them manage their course and unit requirements. This allows them to have a seamless experience with their degree where requirements can easily be managed so that they can focus on their studies and achieve their goals.

CourseFlow aims to be that tool which will facilitate an easy-to-use interface for students to plan their degree and be capable of considering course and unit requirements to ensure students can fulfill all requirements of their course.

### 1.2 Target Audience

Students who struggle to or simply desire to keep track of and manage their course and unit requirements.

### 1.3 Intended Use

To be used by students studying at Deakin University for the purposes of course planning and tracking.

### 1.4 Scope

A working MVP that aims to have a functioning editable course map for each year and trimester with a saveable state and unit/course requirements handled accordingly.


## High-Level Overview and Requirements

This will provide a high-level overview and key requirements of the product.

### User Stories

| User Stories                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| As a student, I want to have my course requirements clearly defined and presented to me so that I know what I need to complete my degree and thus, plan accordingly.                                                                 |
| As a student, I want to have unit requirements to be clearly defined and presented to me so that I know if I can take a unit or not.                                                                                                 | 
| As a student, I want to be able to plan ahead for my course and map out all of my units so that I can ensure all requirements of my degree are met.                                                                                  |
| As a student, I want to be able to have flexibility in the number units and trimesters I take part in so that I can allow flexibility in my course due to being a part-time student or for general flexibility due to my commitments.|
| As a student, I want units presented to me to be groupable by categories so that I can easily filter through units based on my selection criteria.                                                                                   |

### High-Level Requirements

This application requires the following:
- A selection interface for students to select the course they are studying.
- An interface for students to be able to add/update/remove units, trimesters and years in their course map.
- Have course requirements clearly presented to the user.
- Have indicators to inform user if course requirements have not been met if the course map has been filled.
- Have indicators for unit selection and on the course map if requirements for a unit are not met.
- A window to show units for selection which are categorized by logical groupings to make it easier to filter units based on user selection criteria.
- Have the course map state saved at all times.

### Asumptions

At this stage, the key assumption will be that there will be no or limited access to Deakin Universityâ€™s API to get course and unit information. 

Additionally, as an extension to that, it will be assumed that there will be no or limited access to student information, including their enrolment information and their unit status.

These assumptions are subject to change as the project progresses and will be reviewed again at a later date.


## System Architecture

The overall system architecture will be provided in this section.
