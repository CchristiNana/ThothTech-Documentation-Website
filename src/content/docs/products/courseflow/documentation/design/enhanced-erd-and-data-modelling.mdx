title: CourseFlow Enhanced ERD and Data Modelling
description:
  In-depth explanation of the ERD and handling of data in CourseFlow within the context of OnTrack.

## Introduction

This document aims to provide a detailed overview of the data that will be required for CourseFlow
through the use of diagrams and text based explanations.

## Diagrams

---

This section will present some diagrams that will be referenced multiple times throughout the
document.

The diagram below provides an easier to digest, high-level overview of the more detailed Entity
Relationship Diagram (ERD).

The next diagram is the fully fleshed out ERD with the different fields and relationships to other
entities.

## Analysis of the Entity Relationships

---

This section will provide a detailed analysis of the key entities of CourseFlow and how they will
relation to each other.

### Users and Course Map

The users entity already exists within OnTrack and it represents the users of the system (students
etc.). Since CourseFlow will be a new feature of OnTrack, it can utilize this entity for association
to a CourseMap. The aim of this relationship is to associate a student with a single course map and
this is achieved by referencing the user id of the User entity.

Functionally, a student entering the CourseFlow section in OnTrack can use their user id in the API
request and fetch their respective CourseMap.

### Course Map and Courses

This is a simple association. Essentially, each course map will be associated with a single course
that the student is enrolled in.

Functionally, when the course map data is received, a different API request can be made to a course
related route to retrieve the course data via the course id which will be stored with the course map
entity. This data will then be used to load up course related information on the client side.
