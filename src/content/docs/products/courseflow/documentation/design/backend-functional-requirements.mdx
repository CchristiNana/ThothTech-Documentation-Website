  Details of what will be required of the backend for CourseFlow within the OnTrack system.

## Introduction

---

This document will provide an overview of the backend requirements of CourseFlow within OnTrack.
There will be some cross-over of information with other documentation such as the
enhanced-erd-and-data-modelling document and the software design document.

## Course Map

### Routes

Upon entry to the CourseFlow system within OnTrack, the course map associated with the authenticated
user will need to be fetched or created.

As such, the backend needs to have the following routes to cater for this:

| Endpoint                      | Description                                | Request Body | Response Body |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /coursemap/userId         | Get a user's course map via their userId.  | None         | CourseMap     |
| POST /coursemap               | Add a new course map for a user.           | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| PUT /coursemap/coursemapId    | Updates an existing course map via its id. | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId | Deletes an existing course map via its id. | None         | None          |

To further elaborate on each route:

**GET /coursemap/userId**

We need a route to get a course map associated with a user - we can do this via the user id.

**POST /coursemap**

We need to have a way to create a new course map for the user (or a template course map). The client
side interface presenting a list of courses or mechanism connecting with a student's enrollment will
be required to associate the course map with a specific course.

**PUT /coursemap/coursemapId**

Technically speaking, there shouldn't be a need to update the course map entry itself since we can
make direct updates to the course map unit entries. However, the route will be included in case it
is ever needed.

**DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId**

We need a way to delete a course map. This will also require all course map units associated with
this course map to be deleted as well.

### Model

The model for the course map will be as follows:

| Field       | Type    | Description                               |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| courseMapId | Integer | Auto generated id.                        |
| userId      | Integer | OnTrack user id.                          |
| courseId    | Integer | Course id associated with this course map |
| dateAdded   | Date    | Date this entry was added.                |
| dateUpdated | Date    | Date this entry was updated.              |

The main thing to note regarding this model is the course id which will need to be obtained before
creating a new course map entry. This will be utilized to fetch information about the course such as
requirements etc. For the purposes of this model and the associated POST route, the mechanism in
getting the associated course itself is not crucial. The options at present involves:

- Getting student enrolment information via an API to Deakin University's systems.
- Importing student enrolment information.
- Manually setting the course via a client side user interface (will be an input box presenting best
  matching courses).
- Associating a course upon creation of the user and have the course map created at this point in
  time.

This aspect of CourseFlow will require further discussions before more details can be documented
here.
