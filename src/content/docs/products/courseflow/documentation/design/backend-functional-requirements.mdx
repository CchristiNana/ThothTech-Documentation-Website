  Details of what will be required of the backend for CourseFlow within the OnTrack system.

## Introduction

---

This document will provide an overview of the backend requirements of CourseFlow within OnTrack.
There will be some cross-over of information with other documentation such as the
enhanced-erd-and-data-modelling document and the software design document.

## Course Map

---

### Routes

Upon entry to the CourseFlow system within OnTrack, the course map associated with the authenticated
user will need to be fetched or created.

As such, the backend needs to have the following routes to cater for this:

| Endpoint                      | Description                                | Request Body | Response Body |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /coursemap/userId         | Get a user's course map via their userId.  | None         | CourseMap     |
| GET /coursemap/courseId       | Get all course maps via the course id.     | None         | CourseMap[]   |
| POST /coursemap               | Add a new course map for a user.           | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| PUT /coursemap/coursemapId    | Updates an existing course map via its id. | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId | Deletes an existing course map via its id. | None         | None          |

To further elaborate on each route:

**GET /coursemap/userId**

We need a route to get a course map associated with a user - we can do this via the user id.

**GET /coursemap/courseId**

This specific route is mostly going to be for templates of a course map. Essentially, if we cannot
find a course map for a user, we will need to trigger a response to add a new course map. Once we
have the associated course for the student (obtained via mechanisms described below), we can use the
course id to fetch all course maps with that id that do not have a user id which will be implied to
be templates (with pre-set course map units at the proper position).

As mentioned but worth repeating, for this to work properly, this has to only include course map
data without a user id (we do not want to fetch course maps belonging to other students). When a
template is chosen, we will create a duplicate of the associated data to be added as new entries for
both the course map (with the associated user id this time) and the course map units.

**POST /coursemap**

We need to have a way to create a new course map for the user (or a template course map). The client
side interface presenting a list of courses or mechanism connecting with a student's enrollment will
be required to associate the course map with a specific course.

**PUT /coursemap/coursemapId**

Technically speaking, there shouldn't be a need to update the course map entry itself since we can
make direct updates to the course map unit entries. However, the route will be included in case it
is ever needed.

**DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId**

We need a way to delete a course map. This will also require all course map units associated with
this course map to be deleted as well.

### Model

The model for the course map will be as follows:

| Field       | Type    | Description                               |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| courseMapId | Integer | Auto generated id.                        |
| userId      | Integer | OnTrack user id.                          |
| courseId    | Integer | Course id associated with this course map |
| dateAdded   | Date    | Date this entry was added.                |
| dateUpdated | Date    | Date this entry was updated.              |

The main thing to note regarding this model is the course id which will need to be obtained before
creating a new course map entry. This will be utilized to fetch information about the course such as
requirements etc. For the purposes of this model and the associated POST route, the mechanism in
getting the associated course itself is not crucial. The options at present involves:

- Getting student enrolment information via an API to Deakin University's systems.
- Importing student enrolment information.
- Manually setting the course via a client side user interface (will be an input box presenting best
  matching courses).
- Associating a course upon creation of the user and have the course map created at this point in
  time.

This aspect of CourseFlow will require further discussions before more details can be documented
here.

## Course Map Unit

---

### Routes

This has a strong association with the course map and upon entry into the CourseFlow system, once we
have the course map associated with the user fetched, we can use the course map id to fetch all course map
units that belongs to the specific course map.

| Endpoint                              | Description                                                    | Request Body  | Response Body   |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| GET /coursemapunit/courseMapId        | Get a all course map units associated with the course map id.  | None          | CourseMapUnit[] |
| POST /coursemapunit                   | Add a new course map unit for a user.                          | CourseMapUnit | CourseMapUnit   |
| PUT /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId    | Updates an existing course map unit via its id.                | CourseMapUnit | CourseMapUnit   |
| DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId | Deletes an existing course map unit via its id.                | None          | None            |
| DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapId     | Deletes all course map units via the associated course map id. | None          | None            |

To further elaborate on each route:

**GET /coursemapunit/courseMapId**

Here, we use the course map id to fetch all course map units associated with that id. This will essentially retrieve user/student specific set course map units.

**POST /coursemapunit**

This is needed to add new course map units for a specific course map. 

Please note that for this to be correct, we will not only need to associate this with a course map, but also to specific instance of a unit (a unit version that belongs to a specific year and teaching period etc.).

**PUT /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId**

This allows for updating a course map unit. The main use case for this is when a user is moving a unit around within the course map or performing a swap with another unit. Here, we can make direct calls to this route and update the data with new positional information (slot positions).

**DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId**

A simple delete route where we can delete a course map unit via its id.

**DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapId**

This extra delete route will allow for deleting of all course map units based on the course map id. This will be useful when deleting the course map which will also require a delete of all course map units. 

It is worth mentioning that there might be functionality with regards to Ruby on Rails that can delete all course map units once the course map has been deleted. If this is the case, this route will be redundant and we only need the delete route for the course map.

### Model

The model for the course map unit will be as follows:

| Field              | Type    | Description                  |
|--------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| courseMapUnitId    | Integer | Auto generated id.           |
| courseMapId        | Integer | Associated course map id.    |
| unitId             | Integer | Associated unit id.          |
| yearSlot           | Integer | Year slot.                   |
| teachingPeriodSlot | Integer | Teaching period slot.        |
| unitSlot           | Integer | Unit slot.                   |
| createdAt          | Date    | Date this entry was added.   |
| updatedAt          | Date    | Date this entry was updated. |

So, the key factors here are:

- Course map id which will associate a specific course map to the respective course map units.
- Unit id which will associate the course map unit with a unit. This in itself will allow obtaining of unit information such as name, unit code, handbook url and requirements etc.
- All three slot fields and their respective values will allow for matching to the correct spot on the client side visuals. For example:
  - If we have 2021 as a year slot value, the unit will go to the 2021 container.
  - If teaching period slot is 1, the unit will go to the teaching period container inside the respective year container associated with that value (in the case of Deakin, this will be associated to the Trimester 1 slot).
  - If the unit slot is 4, this will go to the 4th unit slot within the respective teaching period container.
