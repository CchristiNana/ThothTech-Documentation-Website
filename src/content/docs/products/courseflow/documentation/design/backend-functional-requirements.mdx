## Introduction

---

This document will provide an overview of the backend requirements of CourseFlow within OnTrack.
There will be some cross-over of information with other documentation such as the
enhanced-erd-and-data-modelling document and the software design document.

## Course Map

---

### Routes

Upon entry to the CourseFlow system within OnTrack, the course map associated with the authenticated
user will need to be fetched or created.

As such, the backend needs to have the following routes to cater for this:

| Endpoint                      | Description                                | Request Body | Response Body |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /coursemap/userId         | Get a user's course map via their userId.  | None         | CourseMap     |
| GET /coursemap/courseId       | Get all course maps via the course id.     | None         | CourseMap[]   |
| POST /coursemap               | Add a new course map for a user.           | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| PUT /coursemap/coursemapId    | Updates an existing course map via its id. | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId | Deletes an existing course map via its id. | None         | None          |

To further elaborate on each route:

**GET /coursemap/userId**

We need a route to get a course map associated with a user - we can do this via the user id.

**GET /coursemap/courseId**

This specific route is mostly going to be for templates of a course map. Essentially, if we cannot
find a course map for a user, we will need to trigger a response to add a new course map. Once we
have the associated course for the student (obtained via mechanisms described below), we can use the
course id to fetch all course maps with that id that do not have a user id which will be implied to
be templates (with pre-set course map units at the proper position).

As mentioned but worth repeating, for this to work properly, this has to only include course map
data without a user id (we do not want to fetch course maps belonging to other students). When a
template is chosen, we will create a duplicate of the associated data to be added as new entries for
both the course map (with the associated user id this time) and the course map units.

**POST /coursemap**

We need to have a way to create a new course map for the user (or a template course map). The client
side interface presenting a list of courses or mechanism connecting with a student's enrollment will
be required to associate the course map with a specific course.

**PUT /coursemap/coursemapId**

Technically speaking, there shouldn't be a need to update the course map entry itself since we can
make direct updates to the course map unit entries. However, the route will be included in case it
is ever needed.

**DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId**

We need a way to delete a course map. This will also require all course map units associated with
this course map to be deleted as well.

### Model

The model for the course map will be as follows:

| Field       | Type    | Description                               |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| courseMapId | Integer | Auto generated id.                        |
| userId      | Integer | OnTrack user id.                          |
| courseId    | Integer | Course id associated with this course map |
| dateAdded   | Date    | Date this entry was added.                |
| dateUpdated | Date    | Date this entry was updated.              |

The main thing to note regarding this model is the course id which will need to be obtained before
creating a new course map entry. This will be utilized to fetch information about the course such as
requirements etc. For the purposes of this model and the associated POST route, the mechanism in
getting the associated course itself is not crucial. The options at present involves:

- Getting student enrolment information via an API to Deakin University's systems.
- Importing student enrolment information.
- Manually setting the course via a client side user interface (will be an input box presenting best
  matching courses).
- Associating a course upon creation of the user and have the course map created at this point in
  time.

This aspect of CourseFlow will require further discussions before more details can be documented
here.

## Course Map Unit

---

### Routes

This has a strong association with the course map and upon entry into the CourseFlow system, once we
have the course map associated with the user fetched, we can use the course map id to fetch all
course map units that belongs to the specific course map.

| Endpoint                              | Description                                                    | Request Body  | Response Body   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| GET /coursemapunit/courseMapId        | Get a all course map units associated with the course map id.  | None          | CourseMapUnit[] |
| POST /coursemapunit                   | Add a new course map unit for a user.                          | CourseMapUnit | CourseMapUnit   |
| PUT /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId    | Updates an existing course map unit via its id.                | CourseMapUnit | CourseMapUnit   |
| DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId | Deletes an existing course map unit via its id.                | None          | None            |
| DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapId     | Deletes all course map units via the associated course map id. | None          | None            |

To further elaborate on each route:

**GET /coursemapunit/courseMapId**

Here, we use the course map id to fetch all course map units associated with that id. This will
essentially retrieve user/student specific set course map units.

**POST /coursemapunit**

This is needed to add new course map units for a specific course map.

Please note that for this to be correct, we will not only need to associate this with a course map,
but also to specific instance of a unit (a unit version that belongs to a specific year and teaching
period etc.).

**PUT /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId**

This allows for updating a course map unit. The main use case for this is when a user is moving a
unit around within the course map or performing a swap with another unit. Here, we can make direct
calls to this route and update the data with new positional information (slot positions).

**DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId**

A simple delete route where we can delete a course map unit via its id.

**DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapId**

This extra delete route will allow for deleting of all course map units based on the course map id.
This will be useful when deleting the course map which will also require a delete of all course map
units.

It is worth mentioning that there might be functionality with regards to Ruby on Rails that can
delete all course map units once the course map has been deleted. If this is the case, this route
will be redundant and we only need the delete route for the course map.

### Model

The model for the course map unit will be as follows:

| Field              | Type    | Description                  |
| ------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| courseMapUnitId    | Integer | Auto generated id.           |
| courseMapId        | Integer | Associated course map id.    |
| unitId             | Integer | Associated unit id.          |
| yearSlot           | Integer | Year slot.                   |
| teachingPeriodSlot | Integer | Teaching period slot.        |
| unitSlot           | Integer | Unit slot.                   |
| createdAt          | Date    | Date this entry was added.   |
| updatedAt          | Date    | Date this entry was updated. |

So, the key factors here are:

- Course map id which will associate a specific course map to the respective course map units.
- Unit id which will associate the course map unit with a unit. This in itself will allow obtaining
  of unit information such as name, unit code, handbook url and requirements etc.
- All three slot fields and their respective values will allow for matching to the correct spot on
  the client side visuals. For example:
  - If we have 2021 as a year slot value, the unit will go to the 2021 container.
  - If teaching period slot is 1, the unit will go to the teaching period container inside the
    respective year container associated with that value (in the case of Deakin, this will be
    associated to the Trimester 1 slot).
  - If the unit slot is 4, this will go to the 4th unit slot within the respective teaching period
    container.

### Routes

The routes involved with this will be relatively straightforward.

| Endpoint                | Description                                         | Request Body | Response Body |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /course             | Get all course data.                                | None         | Course[]      |
| GET /course/courseId    | Get a course by id.                                 | None         | Course        |
| GET /course/search      | Get courses that partially match the search params. | None         | Course[]      |
| POST /course            | Add a new course.                                   | Course       | Course        |
| PUT /course/courseId    | Updates an existing course via its id.              | Course       | Course        |
| DELETE /course/courseId | Deletes an existing course via its id.              | None         | None          |

The table above covers the function of each route quite well and thus, further explanation for each
will be excluded here.

### Model

The Course model will be as follows:

| Field       | Type    | Description                  |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| courseId    | Integer | Auto generated id.           |
| name        | String  | Name of course.              |
| code        | String  | Course code.                 |
| year        | Integer | Respective year of course.   |
| version     | String  | Course version number.       |
| url         | String  | Link to the course webpage.  |
| dateAdded   | Date    | Date this entry was added.   |
| dateUpdated | Date    | Date this entry was updated. |

Here, the main thing worth mentioning is the year, version and url.

In terms of the year and version, this is the way the system keeps track of different versions of
courses. Technically speaking, a course would likely only have different versions on a per year
basis. However, to cater for the possibility that a course of a particular year gets updated, it
would be a good idea to keep a history of this. The course map will keep track of a specific entry
of a Course which will allow students to load up the correct version of the course (which by
extension, will allow loading of the correct course requirements which will also be tied to specific
course versions).

The url will link to the course page which will provide more information about the course (that
don't need to be present in CourseFlow such as contacts and entry requirements etc.). This can
either be presented on the client side as a simple link or used to embed the course page within an
IFrame element.

## Unit

### Routes

| Endpoint            | Description                          | Request Body | Response Body |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /unit           | Get all units                        | None         | Unit[]        |
| GET /unit/unitId    | Get a unit by id.                    | None         | Unit          |
| GET /unit/search    | Get all units by search params       | None         | Unit[]        |
| POST /unit          | Add a new unit.                      | Unit         | Unit          |
| PUT /unit/uniteId   | Updates an existing unit via its id. | Unit         | Unit          |
| DELETE /unit/unitId | Deletes an existing unit via its id. | None         | None          |

With the exception of this route: "GET /unit/specializationId", all other routes can be explained by
the table above.

**GET /unit/specializationId**

The aim of this route is to cater for the functionality of returning a list of units based on search
criteria. The search criteria will at this point in time, consist of:

- specializations
- year
- level
- teaching period

In terms of year and level, these fields will be present within the Unit model and we can perform a
query to include data within the table that conforms to these criteria.

Searching for specializations will require additional considerations. The data modelling for this
consists of:

- Specializations
- UnitSpecializations
- Units

Firstly, we will have a specializations table (more details on routes and model later) which will
consist of a list of different specializations. The ids for these specializations are used in
conjunction with the unit id to create a unit specialization entry. In other words, within the
UnitSpecializations, we can have a single unit marked by the same unit id, appear multiple times,
each with different specialization ids. This will essentially create the list of specializations
associated with a specific version of a unit.

On the client side, we would have performed a fetch for all specializations to populate a drop down
menu or some kind of list where we can select the specializations we want to search for. The data
here will contain the specialization ids. As such, an approach for this searching functionality is
to include the list of specialization ids which can be used to query the UnitSpecializations table
to return back all unit ids which match the specialization ids.

The teaching period search will follow a similar process where teaching periods will be loaded on
the client side with their ids. Upon selection, we can use the ids and search the Units table for
all units that match the teaching period ids.

Ultimately, the end result will be a list of units that need to take into consideration all of the
search parameters and include/exclude units accordingly.
